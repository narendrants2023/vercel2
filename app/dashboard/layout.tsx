// Dashboards have some sort of navigation that is shared across multiple pages. In Next.js, you can use a special layout.tsx file to create UI that is shared between multiple pages. Let's create a layout for the dashboard pages!

// Inside the /dashboard folder, add a new file called layout.tsx and paste the following code:

import SideNav from "@/app/ui/dashboard/sidenav";

export default function Layout({children}: {children: React.ReactNode}){
    return(
        <div className="flex h-screen flex-col md:flex-row md:overflow-hidden">
            <div className="w-full flex-none md:w-64">
                <SideNav/>
            </div>
            <div className="flex-grow p-6 md:overflow-y-auto md:p-12">
                {children}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
